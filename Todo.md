There is so much to do!

- [x] "Calculating" legal moves for pieces
- [ ] To be able to actually move pieces
- [ ] "Move ordering" (e.g. whites are first to move, then blacks are and so on)
- [ ] Determining mates/checkmates
- [ ] Fancy chess rules implementation (castling, en passant and etc.)
- [ ] Drag and drop pieces

and beyond...
